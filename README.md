# EyeC

This is an **Android** app developed during [Great Uni Hack 2015](http://greatunihack.com) by:
* Alexandru Blinda
* Alexandru Rosu
* Tudor Suruceanu
* Andrei-Marius Longhin

We are **Project ATAA**, a team of enthusiastic students at [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk) who love coding.

## What it does

This application helps visually impaired people find their way inside **CLOSED** spaces (e.g. supermarkets, schools etc.). It interacts with them using **voice recongition** and **text-to-speech** technologies, so as to allow them to use the app at it's full potential without any visual interaction being necessary.

## How it works
People that are in charge of the building (e.g. supermarket manager/owner) place [Estimote Beacons] (http://estimote.com) in key places of their establishments (e.g. meat aisle) and whenever the phone enters a beacon's area it picks up a signal from it and lets the user know where he's at and any additional information, as configured by the manager (e.g. today's offers for meat, directions to other aisles etc.).
It could also get and process queries from the user (e.g. Take me to dairy products aisle) and give intuitive directions for him to get there.

## How to run it 
WILL BE UPDATED SOON

## Techonolgies used
* Text-to-speech
* Voice recognition
* Estimote Beacons
 
## The future ##
* GUI for building managers to configure Beacons in their establishments
* Make localisation more precise
